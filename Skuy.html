		<h2> Overview </h2>
		<p> Skuy is a fully functional iOS and Android app built around college campuses (Northwestern University) allowing students to find their communities and have access to various news aggregation and campus tools. Skuy currently offers the following: 

<br><br>- Topic-based communities with post, comment, and like functions

<br><br>- News widget that auto-updates daily with 3 articles from campus newspapers

<br><br>- Dining hall widget that auto updates daily with meals from all dining halls on Northwestern’s campus

<br><br>- Profile page with tags for social media and custom biographies </p>

<div id="Problem">
<h2> The Problem </h2>
<p> Skuy began in Northwestern’s start-up incubator “The Garage.” Myself and a couple other interested students set out to solve a number of problems campus faced such as: </p>
<h1> “Campus feels so disconnected”

<br><br>“How do I find people interested in the same topics as me?”

<br><br>“What do I use to find out what’s happening on campus?” </h1>

<p> Skuy became our solution </p>
</div>
<div id="Role">
<div id="Roletext">
<h2> My Role </h2>
<p> I serve as one of two Product Managers for Skuy, leading everything platform related. By platform, I mean everything related to user research, feature ideation and decisions, design directions, and development.

<br><br>My philosophy when working on Skuy is:

<br><br>- Always do discovery on what features our users WANT and NEED

<br><br>- Iterate, iterate, and iterate more on our designs

<br><br>- Build our features in sustainable ways that allow us to leverage that work for later development 

<br><br>To the right are screenshots of some of my work, such as spreadsheets documenting and prioritizing features, bugs, and other tasks. Additionally there are screenshots of our metrics from past user research that we have used to inform our decisions.

<br><br>Skuy is an ongoing development! If you are interested in learning more, please contact me! </p>
