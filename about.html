				<p> Hey! I'm Bryan Sanchez, a First-Generation Low-Income New Jersey native and an incoming Associate Product Manager at Capital One. 

 

Right now I am a Northwestern University senior studying Learning and Organizational Change, pursuing the Human-Computer Interaction Certificate, and the Segal Design Certificate.

 

As a passionate, hardworking, and experienced product builder I view my experiences in and out of my academics as puzzle pieces that help to build the best products for users. Whether itâ€™s launching national products that disrupt the real estate industry or developing an all-inclusive university campus app from scratch, I believe the best approach to products and users is an all-inclusive, interdisciplinary one. 

 

Outside of my work, I am a competitive ballroom dancer, an avid rock climber, and food blogger (in the works)!

 

With the curiosity to explore and get the most out of every experience, I hope to continue being challenged intellectually and collaborate with as many people as possible!.</p>
